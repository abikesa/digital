    "# Lets Release a Plugin For Clinicians & Public Health Specialists\n",
    "\n",
    "> The only input it requires is a coefficient matrix, variance-covariance matrix, base-case hazard. Missing information will be replaced with defaults and the clinician or end-user can be guided into building an _a priori_. Appropriately for a `plugin`, this input is universal algebra, independent of Python, AI, R, Stata\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between a plugin and an app are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functionality:\n",
    "   - A plugin is an add-on that extends or enhances the functionality of an existing application or platform.\n",
    "   - An app (application) is a standalone software program designed to perform specific tasks or functions independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dependency:\n",
    "   - Plugins are dependent on a host application to run and cannot function on their own.\n",
    "   - Apps are self-contained and can run independently without relying on other software.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Integration:\n",
    "   - Plugins integrate into existing software, often seamlessly, to add new features or capabilities.\n",
    "   - Apps operate as separate entities and don't necessarily integrate with other software unless designed to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scope:\n",
    "   - Plugins typically have a focused purpose, addressing specific needs within a larger application.\n",
    "   - Apps can have a broader scope, offering a wide range of features and functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Installation:\n",
    "   - Plugins are usually installed within the host application or platform.\n",
    "   - Apps are installed directly on the operating system or device.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. User interface:\n",
    "   - Plugins often adopt the user interface of the host application.\n",
    "   - Apps have their own distinct user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a browser extension is a type of plugin that adds functionality to a web browser, while a word processing program is a standalone app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of plugins or apps?"
